<p>My name is Mothusi Junior Ramafoko,born on 13 March 2007,i`m fifteen year`s old.I live with my aunt in Platinum Village and i`m a young cautious but yet experinmental teen who likes to explore new things.                                                                     <br>                                                                                                                                       <br>                                                                                                                                      <p>As curious and willing to learn new things,that lead me to having an interest in robotics,science today and learning new languages for example spanish and japannese,it may not be common to most people but I find other languages and cultures amusing.My hobbies are gardning,playing soccer,doing indoor exercises,liestning to music,watching movies and anime.As arrogant as I tend to be I really don`t like judgemental people along with bullies,I just can`t seem to comprehend people like that,they really know how to push my buttons.</p>

    <p>I`m a grade 11 maths and science learner,subjects which include <i>Setswana,English FAL,Pure Mathematics,Physical Sciences,Life Sciences and Life Orientation</i>.I`m currently schooling at Platinum Vilage Secondary.I chose to be a maths and science learner because I someday hope to be an aerial engineer,and these subjects are compulsary for this career.Even if I may not be the highest in my grade nor in my class it doesn`t mean i`m not smart,it just means i need to work twice as hard,if I had to guess,i`d say my grades stand high above most of the average learners in my grade.I overperform in my languages and underperform in <i>mathematics.</i>I hope to someday archieve full distinctions in all my subjects.</p>
